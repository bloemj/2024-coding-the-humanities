## Contents

0. [Hello World](notebooks/0_HelloWorld.ipynb): Preparation notebook to check if things work. If you want to run Python locally on your own machine instead of in the cloud, use [this one](notebooks/0_HelloWorld_localinstall.ipynb).
1. [Python variables](notebooks/1_Variables.ipynb): Basic information on variables in Python -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/1_Variables_supplemental.ipynb)
2. [Text](notebooks/2_Text.ipynb): Text strings and dictionaries -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/2_Text_supplemental.ipynb)
3. [Flow control](notebooks/3_FlowControl.ipynb): Conditional statements, loops and functions -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/3_FlowControl_supplemental.ipynb)
4. [Reading and writing files](notebooks/4_ReadingAndWritingFiles.ipynb): Reading and writing files from and to disk -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/4_ReadingAndWritingFiles_supplemental.ipynb)
5. [Data wrangling with Pandas](notebooks/5_PandasDataWrangling.ipynb): Introduction to Pandas, the go-to library for data analysis. Loading, cleaning and transforming data for analysis -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/5_PandasDataWrangling_supplemental.ipynb)
6. [Working with Tweets](notebooks/6_WorkingTweets.ipynb): working with data from Twitter -- [Supplementary materials](notebooks/6_WorkingTweets_supplemental.ipynb)

### Advanced optional content
7. (optional) [Web Scraping and APIs](notebooks/7_WebScraping.ipynb): scraping the Web and APIs for data.
8. (optional) [Working with Texts](notebooks/8_WorkingTexts.ipynb): the Natural Language Processing pipeline to work with texts.

We will use some **datasets** from [this course](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/tree/master/data).

## Set-up
**See a more detailed [guide to setup your environment](setup.md), with multiple options.**

### Working with Google Colab

Using Google Colab, you can open our course materials from Github directly and keep the whole process in the cloud. View the list of class notebooks that are available for running and editing by going to your Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/ and loading them using the "Open Notebook" window, which appears when you first log in. Choose the GitHub option (second option from the right) and enter the GitHub link of our course materials: https://github.com/bloemj/2023-coding-the-humanities

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

* Option 1 (recommended): Download [the repository contents](https://github.com/bloemj/2024-coding-the-humanities) and use Jupyter Notebook. See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.

* Option 2 (advanced): work directly with git and conda. See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.


* Option 3 (fallback): Use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) (link above). Keep in mind you need to download your notebooks to save them locally. (Note: Binder )

### Editor

If you wish to write code without using Colab or a notebook, you will need an **editor** to write code and edit files offline on your own system. If you don't have a preferred one yet, check [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
